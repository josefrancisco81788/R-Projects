## Set up Libraries and Data
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(grf)
library(shapr)
library("caret") # used for various predictive models
library(rpart.plot) # used to plot decision tree

#setwd("G:/My Drive/Stern Teaching/Data mining in R/Labs - in class use-cases/Lab13 - HTE-CausalForest")
path <- rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path
Encoding(path) <- "UTF-8"
setwd(dirname(path))
df <- read.csv('focal_user_df_females.csv')
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
